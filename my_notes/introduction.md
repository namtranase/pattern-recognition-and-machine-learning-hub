# History
Some basic concepts of Pattern Problem:
- Supervised learning: Classification, Regression
- Unsuperviserd learning: Clustering, density estimation, visualization (dimension reduction)
- Reinforcement learning

Some important tool use through the book:
- probablility theory
- decision theory
- information theory

 - Using RMS errors to validate the generation of model
 - Watch the over-fitting problem! (Using the bayansian, maximum likelihood to solve)
 - Introducing the regularization, in order to discourage the coefficients from reaching large values
  => quadratic regularizer (`ridge regression`), in neural networks this approach is known as weight decay.
